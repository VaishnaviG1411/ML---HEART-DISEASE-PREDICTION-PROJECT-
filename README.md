# ML---HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION-PROJECT-
Conducted ML classification analyses in RStudio, selecting optimal algorithms for heart disease detection and assessed predictor importance.

Enhancing Cardiac Disease Detection with Machine Learning 

Introduction:
For the health care industry, using machine learning techniques that can help with the 
early identification and prediction of heart disease would be very beneficial. Therefore, This Project is 
motivated by the quest to find the most effective Machine Learning algorithm for detecting heart diseases. 
Additionally, the factors that play a significant role in predicting cardiac diseases could also cause the 
disease. Hence, that would be helpful for both the patients and health care providers. Thus, this project also 
aims to rank the importance of various factors that are helpful in predicting cardiac disease. 

Data Set: 
This is an open data set which is clean and ready to use. Present in Kaggle and in UCI Machine 
Learning Repository. This dataset is publicly available for research purposes only.
